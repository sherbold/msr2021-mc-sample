    "# Data Science and Big Data Analytics - Group Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "For the project, we give you access to a database we actively use for our research on open source software development. The database contains information collected from the version control system, the issue tracker, and the mailing lists of the projects. [You can find a documentation of the available data online](https://smartshark2.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/documentation/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Your task\n",
    "\n",
    "The database contains data for many Apache Projects. For your group projects, only the following 39 projects are relevant:\n",
    "- ant-ivy, archiva, calcite, cayenne, commons-bcel, commons-beanutils, commons-codec, commons-collections, commons-compress, commons-configuration, commons-dbcp, commons-digester, commons-io, commons-jcs, commons-jexl, commons-lang, commons-math, commons-net, commons-rdf, commons-scxml, commons-validator, commons-vfs, deltaspike, eagle, giraph, gora, jspwiki, kylin, lens, mahout, manifoldcf, nutch, opennlp, parquet-mr, santuario-java, systemml, tika, wss4j\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to develop an automated model for the classification of issues as bugs. The model should be designed in such a way that it could be applied upon creation of an issue, i.e., as a recommendation system for users of the issue tracking system. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have to frame these questions into an analytic problem. Then, you have to create models that can be used to answer the questions. You have to choose appropriate features from the available data for this and decide which kind of analytic approach to use. Finally, you have to evaluate how well your approach performs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Group registrations\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to work in groups of three people on this task. **One member of each group must register the whole group via an email to Johannes Erbel (johannes.erbel@cs.uni-goettingen.de) until Thursday, Dec 5th**. If you are fewer than three people, you register the same way and we will assign you additional group members from other groups with less than three people on Dec 7th. **This registration, as well as the successful participation of your group is a mandatory requirement for the participation in the exam!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Presentation and voting\n",
    "\n",
    "**All results must be presented in the final lecture on Feb 4th, which will already start at 14:00 o'clock.** Each group must give four minute presentation. Within this presentation, you should briefly describe which data you analyzed, how you treated it, which models you used, and your key findings. The time available for the presentation depends on the number of groups and may be increased. This will be announced in January.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, everybody in attendance will vote to determine the best project. Each group votes for the best project (3 points), second best (2 points), and third best (1 point). The one with the most points wins a price. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission of the presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow the presentation session to run smoothly, each group must submit their presentation beforehand. \n",
    "**Send the presentation latest on Feb 4th, 10:00 o'clock to Steffen Herbold via Email (herbold@cs.uni-goettingen.de)**. The presentations must be either PDF, PPT, PPTX, or ODP. Other formats are not allowed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Success criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The following criteria must be fulfilled by a project, such that the group members can participate in the exam:\n",
    "- A model for automated issue type classification.\n",
    "- An evaluation of the quality of the issue type classification model.\n",
    "- A recommendation on how the model could be used, including key benefits and risks.\n",
    "- The model must be applied to at least 30 projects from the database, which must all be considered for the evaluation.\n",
    "- A presentation of the results is given in the final lecture on Feb 4th.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below shows how to access the data with Python. Please note that the database is behind a firewall and can only be accessed from within the Goenet. If you cannot reach the database, just establish a connection to the [VPN of the GWDG](https://info.gwdg.de/docs/doku.php?id=en:services:network_services:vpn:anyconnect) and it should be reachable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING:\n",
    "Because we also actively use the MongoDB in our research, there can sometimes be heavy load on the database. The database currently contains 6.5 Terabytes of data. Do not just randomly query the database, but fetch only the data you need. Otherwise you might easily try to download several Gigabytes of data. For example, if you want to fetch all information that is stored in the ```commit``` collection, you will download 114 Gigabytes of data.**"
